A distribution is said to be symmetric if it looks the same on both sides of the center point, which is typically the mean or median of the data. \n",

On the other hand, if the tail is longer on the right side of the distribution, then it is said to be right-skewed or positively skewed.\n",

For example, when the data is skewed, the mean is often not a good measure of central tendency, because it is affected by the outliers. Instead, the median is often a better measure of central tendency for skewed data. \n",

For example, consider the following dataset of 10 salaries in thousands of dollars: {30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 200}. The variance of this dataset is 2970.8 and the standard deviation is 54.5, which are both inflated due to the outlier salary of 200 thousand dollars. If we remove the outlier salary, the variance becomes 199.5 and the standard deviation becomes 14.1, which are more representative of the salaries in the dataset.\n",

    "In summary, outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion, and it's important to identify and handle them appropriately in statistical analysis."
